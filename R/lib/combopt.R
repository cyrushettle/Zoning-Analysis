# R modules for solving the optimization problem in zoning analysis.
# The scripts includes optimization methods as follow:
# - Simulated Annealing
# 
# These methods are based on searching the neighborhood to find the local
# optimum. The neighborhood of the solution can be only found when the
# edges exist in the adjancency matrix.

# R code for applying regression analysis between census data and police workload.
# L1 penalty will be applied onto census features in order to select the most 
# important factors that have principal impact on the change of workload.

# Step 1.
# Read data from local files. The dataset is organized hierarchically by the 
# categories of census feature and years. The following code would traverse 
# through the hierarchy of files and read the data into dataframes.
# - Census data for population 
population.df = read.census(
  data.dir, 
  'population, age and sex, race and ethnicity', 
  population.factors)

# - Census data for Education
education.df = read.census(

  'Educational Attainment', 
  education.factors)

# - Census data for Household income in the past 12 months
employment.df = read.census(
  data.dir, 
  'Employment Status', 
  employment.factors)

# - Workload by beat
workload.df = read.workload(workload.path)

# Step 2.
# Merge all the census data into a dataframe, and convert the data in
# the table from zipcode to beat.
